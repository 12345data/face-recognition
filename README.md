# Face Recognition 
Repository for face recognition related scripts.

For work I got involved in a project that dealt with face recognition. For this project, we created a robot based on a Lego Mindstorms EV3 unit that can navigate autonomously through a world and which could find persons based on face recogntion.

In this repository I will publish scripts related to this project.

More details about this project can be found in the [post](https://www.guidodiepen.nl/2017/02/detecting-and-tracking-a-face-with-python-and-opencv/) on my blog.
